# Banking Operations System in BankApp

BankApp implements a comprehensive banking operations system that enables secure money transfers between accounts using
different identification methods (IBAN or email) while ensuring proper validation, security, and transaction processing.

## System Architecture

The banking operations system follows a multi-layered architecture pattern:

1. **API Layer** (`BankingOperationsController`, `BankingOperationsControllerInterface`)
    - Handles HTTP requests for banking operations
    - Implements REST API endpoints for different types of transfers
    - Provides detailed API documentation through Swagger annotations
    - Returns standardized response formats

2. **Service Layer**
    - **Core Transfer Service** (`TransferOperationService`)
        - Provides unified interface for transfer operations
        - Coordinates the transfer process
        - Manages transaction creation and registration

    - **Specialized Transfer Services**
        - `IbanTransferService` - Handles transfers using IBAN numbers
        - `EmailTransferService` - Handles transfers using email addresses

3. **Security Layer** (`AccountSecurityService`)
    - Validates account ownership
    - Prevents unauthorized access to accounts
    - Ensures secure transaction processing

4. **Transaction Building Layer** (`TransactionBuilderService`)
    - Coordinates transaction creation process
    - Uses TransactionBuilder to construct transaction objects
    - Determines and assigns appropriate transaction types
    - Manages the transfer of required information to the builder

5. **Analysis Layer** (`IbanAnalysisService`)
    - Analyzes IBAN numbers to determine transfer types
    - Identifies own/internal/external transfers

## System Features

### Transfer Types

1. **IBAN-based Transfers**
    - Direct transfers using IBAN numbers
    - Support for both internal and external transfers
    - Automatic detection of transfer type (own/internal/external)

2. **Email-based Transfers**
    - Transfers using recipient's email address
    - Automatic resolution of email to account details
    - Simplified user experience for frequent transfers

### Transfer Processing

The system processes transfers through several steps:

1. **Request Validation**
    - Validates input data (amount, IBAN format, email format)
    - Checks for required fields
    - Ensures positive transfer amounts

2. **Account Verification**
    - Verifies source account ownership
    - Validates destination account existence
    - Checks account access permissions

3. **Transaction Creation**
    - Builds transaction with appropriate type
    - Assigns unique transaction identifiers
    - Records transaction details

4. **Transfer Type Resolution**
    - Analyzes IBAN numbers to determine:
        - External transfers (different banks)
        - Internal transfers (same bank, different owner)
        - Own transfers (same owner, same bank)

## Security and Validation

The system implements multiple security layers:

- **Account Ownership Verification**:
    - Strict validation of account ownership
    - Prevention of unauthorized access
    - Secure handling of account information

- **Input Validation**:
    - IBAN format validation
    - Email format validation
    - Amount validation
    - Required field checks

- **Error Handling**:
    - Comprehensive exception handling
    - Detailed error messages
    - Secure error responses

- **Transaction Security**:
    - Unique transaction IDs
    - Transaction tracking
    - Secure processing

## Detailed Implementation

### Design Patterns

1. **Builder Pattern**
    - Used in transaction creation
    - Provides clear and flexible object construction
    - Ensures proper initialization

2. **Strategy Pattern**
    - Different transfer types (IBAN/Email)
    - Flexible transfer processing
    - Extensible design

3. **DTO Pattern**
    - Clear separation of API and domain models
    - Structured request/response objects
    - Validation annotations

4. **Service Layer Pattern**
    - Separation of concerns
    - Business logic encapsulation
    - Reusable components

### Key Components

1. **Request Objects**
    - `BankingOperationRequest` - Base class for operations
    - `IbanTransferRequest` - IBAN-based transfers
    - `EmailTransferRequest` - Email-based transfers

2. **Response Objects**
    - `TransferResponse` - Transfer result details
    - Account information
    - Transaction details

3. **Validation**
    - Bean validation annotations
    - Custom validators
    - Business rule validation

### Error Handling

The system provides detailed error responses for various scenarios:

- Invalid input data
- Insufficient funds
- Account ownership issues
- Account not found
- Invalid IBAN format
- Server processing errors

## Future Improvements

1. **New Transfer Methods**
    - Mobile number-based transfers
    - QR code transfers
    - Instant payment integration

2. **Enhanced Security**
    - Two-factor authentication for large transfers
    - Advanced fraud detection
    - Real-time transaction monitoring

3. **Performance Optimization**
    - Asynchronous processing for external transfers
    - Caching frequently used account data
    - Batch processing capabilities

4. **User Experience**
    - Saved recipient management
    - Transfer templates
    - Scheduled transfers

The banking operations system is a critical component of BankApp, providing secure and flexible money transfer
capabilities while maintaining high security standards and user-friendly interfaces.
