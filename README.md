# BankApp

Hi everyone!

I'm working on BankApp – a Java-based banking application for my portfolio. The project has grown significantly, so I'm looking for people who would like to join and help me complete it.

## About the Project

- **Name**: BankApp
- **Purpose**: A banking application for my portfolio
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Java, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, JUnit, Mockito (Spring is a plus but not required)
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Thymeleaf (which I want to replace with a modern frontend)
  - **Additional Tools**: Git, Docker
- **Online**: [bankapp.mackiewicz.info](http://bankapp.mackiewicz.info)

## What Needs to Be Done on the Frontend?

- **Web App for Managing Bank Accounts**: The current version needs UI/UX improvements and optimization.
- **Mobile App for Managing Bank Accounts**: The same as the web app but optimized for mobile devices.
- **Web/Mobile (Android/iOS) App Simulating an ATM/Cash Deposit Machine**: Enabling deposits and withdrawals in a simulated environment.
- **???**: If you have a great idea, I’d love to hear it!

The scope of work depends on how many people get involved and how fast we progress.

## What Needs to Be Done on the Backend?

The backend is mostly complete but still requires improvements and optimizations. I also have a few ideas for additional features, so if you have solid backend skills, there’s definitely work to be done!

## Who Am I Looking For?

- **Frontend Developers**: I need someone who is already comfortable with frontend development or really wants to master it! Basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge won’t be enough – experience with frameworks (React, Angular, or others) would be very useful. Also, the frontend will communicate with the backend via API, so if you’ve worked with APIs before or want to learn, this is a great opportunity!
- **Backend Developers**: Strong Java skills are required. Spring is a plus, but not necessary. If you have experience with Hibernate and MySQL, that’s even better!
- People who can help wrap up the project within 1-2 weeks (or longer if the project expands).

## What Do I Offer?

- Hands-on experience in a real project.
- Collaboration in a friendly and supportive environment.
- A project you can add to your portfolio.

## Additional Information

The frontend and backend will communicate via API, so the frontend will be in a separate repository.

If you're interested, reach out to me on GitHub or email me at pawel@mackiewicz.info

Looking forward to working with you!

Pawel
